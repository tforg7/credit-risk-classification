# credit-risk-prediction
This tool is analyzing the credit risk of investors. Using machine learning and different technics of sampling I tend to demonstrate which technic is the best for a given data set.

The first file 'credit_risk _resampling' covers different technics to resample a set of data. 

The second file 'credit_risk8ensemble' covers two classifiers that help to get better results.
